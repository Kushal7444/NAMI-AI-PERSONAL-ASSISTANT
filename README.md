# NAMI-AI-PERSONAL-ASSISTANT
ONE-PIECE[JUST KIDING]
its a kind of ai assistant 
where you can do you day to day task with any keyboard or mouse just by command
it finishs all the work
SO NOW LET ME TELL YOU HOW IT ACTUALLY WORKS
as you know the assistant name is nami 
it doesn t uses any API KEYS ETC
it is made up of intents or you can say it is traind by intents[i have added around 20 intents i think if you want you can add more ]
basically it can 
1 open apps
2 tell your schedule
3 time date
4 wish you 
5 still many kind of things 

also i will be uplaoding the updated version of NAMI which probably i will name as NICO ROBIN OR ZORO so they can do complex task  so stayed updated
